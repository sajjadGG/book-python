Distributing Packages
=====================


Installing Packages
-------------------
* ``pip search``
* ``pip install``
* ``pip install -r requirements.txt``


``__init__.py``
---------------
* Since Python 3.3 - :pep:`420` -- Implicit Namespace Packages
* https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/linear_model/__init__.py
* https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/views/generic/__init__.py

It is true that Python 3.3+ supports Implicit Namespace Packages that allows it to create a package without an __init__.py file. This is called a namespace package in contrast to a regular package which does have an __init__.py file (empty or not empty).

However, creating a namespace package should ONLY be done if there is a need for it. For most use cases and developers out there, this doesn't apply so you should stick with EMPTY __init__.py files regardless.

Namespace package use case

To demonstrate the difference between the two types of python packages, lets look at the following example:

.. code-block:: text

    google_pubsub/              <- Package 1
        google/                 <- Namespace package (there is no __init__.py)
            cloud/              <- Namespace package (there is no __init__.py)
                pubsub/         <- Regular package (with __init__.py)
                    __init__.py <- Required to make the package a regular package
                    foo.py

    google_storage/             <- Package 2
        google/                 <- Namespace package (there is no __init__.py)
            cloud/              <- Namespace package (there is no __init__.py)
                storage/        <- Regular package (with __init__.py)
                    __init__.py <- Required to make the package a regular package
                    bar.py

google_pubsub and google_storage are separate packages but they share the same namespace google/cloud. In order to share the same namespace, it is required to make each directory of the common path a namespace package, i.e. google/ and cloud/. This should be the only use case for creating namespace packages, otherwise, there is no need for it.

It's crucial that there are no __init__py files in the google and google/cloud directories so that both directories can be interpreted as namespace packages. In Python 3.3+ any directory on the sys.path with a name that matches the package name being looked for will be recognized as contributing modules and subpackages to that package. As a result, when you import both from google_pubsub and google_storage, the Python interpreter will be able to find them.

This is different from regular packages which are self-contained meaning all parts live in the same directory hierarchy. When importing a package and the Python interpreter encounters a subdirectory on the sys.path with an __init__.py file, then it will create a single directory package containing only modules from that directory, rather than finding all appropriately named subdirectories outside that directory. This is perfectly fine for packages that don't want to share a namespace. I highly recommend taking a look at Traps for the Unwary in Python’s Import System to get a better understanding of how Python importing behaves with regular and namespace package and what __init__.py traps to watch out for.

Summary:

    - Only skip __init__.py files if you want to create namespace packages. Only create namespace packages if you have different libraries that reside in different locations and you want them each to contribute a subpackage to the parent package, i.e. the namespace package.
    - Keep on adding empty __init__py to your directories because 99% of the time you just want to create regular packages. Also, Python tools out there such as mypy and pytest require empty __init__.py files to interpret the code structure accordingly. This can lead to weird errors if not done with care.

``__all__``
-----------
* https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/views/generic/__init__.py

.. code-block:: python

    from backend.api_v2.models.click import Click
    from backend.api_v2.models.event import Event
    from backend.api_v2.models.survey import Survey
    from backend.api_v2.models.trial import Trial


    __all__ = ['Click', 'Event', 'Survey', 'Trial']


Creating packages
-----------------

``distutils``
-------------
* Provides support for building and installing additional modules into a Python.
* The new modules may be either 100%-pure Python, or may be extension modules written in C, or may be collections of Python packages which include modules coded in both Python and C.

``setuptools``
--------------
* Enhanced alternative to distutils that provides:

    #. support for declaring project dependencies
    #. additional mechanisms for configuring which files to include in source releases (including plugins for integration with version control systems)
    #. the ability to declare project “entry points”, which can be used as the basis for application plugin systems
    #. the ability to automatically generate Windows command line executables at installation time rather than needing to prebuild them
    #. consistent behaviour across all supported Python versions

Setuptools is a fully-featured, actively-maintained, and stable library designed to facilitate packaging Python projects, where packaging includes:

    * Python package and module definitions
    * Distribution package metadata
    * Test hooks
    * Project installation
    * Platform-specific details
    * Python 3 support

``wheel`` vs. ``egg``
---------------------
* to build a python wheel package
* ``sdist`` will generate a ``.tar.gz`` file in ``dist/``
* ``bdist_wheel`` will generate a ``.whl`` file in ``dist/``

.. code-block:: console

    $ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

.. code-block:: console

    $ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel --universal

``requirements.txt`` vs ``setup.py``
------------------------------------

``setup.py``
------------

.. code-block:: python
