About
=====
* ``re.search()``
* Searches if pattern contains a string


Examples
========
.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Usage of ``re.search()``

    import re


    def contains(pattern, text)
        if re.search(pattern, text):
            return True
        else:
            return False


    COMMIT_MESSAGE = 'MYPROJ-1337, MYPROJ-997 removed obsolete comments'
    JIRA_ISSUEKEY = r'[A-Z]{2,10}-[0-9]{1,6}'
    REDMINE_NUMBER = r'#[0-9]+'

    contains(JIRA_ISSUEKEY, COMMIT_MESSAGE)      # True
