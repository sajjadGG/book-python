Dragon ADR Position Change
==========================
* ADR - Architecture Design Records


Problem
-------
* Move dragon left by 10 and down by 20


Option 1
--------
>>> dragon.shift(left=10, down=20)
>>> dragon.fly(left=10, down=20)

* Good: extensible to 3D
* Good: move by relative shifting (left, right, up, down)
* Good: encapsulation, object knows current position, state and does the move
* Bad: method names are too use-case specific
* Decision: rejected, bad method names

Problem:

>>> dragon.fly(left=10, down=20)
>>> hero.walk(left=10, down=20)     # code duplication


Option 2
--------
>>> dragon.change_position(left=10, down=20)
>>> dragon.position_change(left=10, down=20)

* Good: extensible to 3D
* Good: move by relative shifting (left, right, up, down)
* Good: encapsulation, object knows current position and moves
* Bad: the method names are a bit too complex for
* Decision: candidate, method names are a bit too complex for


Option 3
--------
>>> dragon.move(left=10, down=20)
>>> dragon.move(right=10, up=20)

* Good: extensible to 3D
* Good: move by relative shifting (left, right, up, down)
* Good: encapsulation, object knows current position, state and does the move
* Good: hides business logic (inverted y-axis)
* Good: easy ``.move()``
* Good: you can prevent negative shifting (i.e.: ``left=-10``)
* Decision: candidate


Option 4
--------
>>> dragon.move(x=10, y=20)
>>> dragon.move(x=-10, y=-20)

* Good: extensible to 3D
* Good: move by relative shifting (left, right, up, down)
* Good: encapsulation, object knows current position, state and does the move
* Good: easy ``.move()``
* Bad: you have to know, which axis is ``left`` and with is ``right``
* Bad: requires knowledge of business logic (inverted y-axis)
* Bad: you cannot prevent negative shifting (i.e.: ``x=-10``)
* Bad: the user must know the internals, how to calculate the position, which way is up or down (positive or negative shifting), note that ``y=-20`` means go up by 20 (we have inverted ``y`` axis)
* Decision: rejected, it requires to much inside knowledge of API from user


Option 5
--------
>>> dragon.move_to(x=10, y=20)

* Good: extensible to 3D
* Bad: Move by setting absolute position which is similar to ``.set_position()``, but it differs from it where in ``move()`` you can make an animation of movement, and with ``set_position()`` it happens instantly
* Bad: controller must know other variables, such as speed factor (snail is slower than a dragon), surface on which the dragon is moving (solid is faster than water or ice), injuries (if dragon is not injured with his for example left foot)
* Bad: requires knowledge of business logic (inverted y-axis)
* Decision: rejected, violates Model-View-Controller (MVC)

* Bad: the user must know the internals, how to calculate the position, which way is up or down (positive or negative shifting), note that ``y=-20`` means go up by 20 (we have inverted ``y`` axis)
* Decision: rejected


Option 7
--------
>>> dragon.move_xy(10, -20)

* Good: extensible to 3D
* Bad: Move by setting absolute position
* Bad: controller must know other variables, such as speed factor (snail is slower than a dragon), surface on which the dragon is moving (solid is faster than water or ice), injuries (if dragon is not injured with his for example left foot)

* Bad: not extensible to 3D
* Decision: rejected


Option 10
---------
>>> dragon.move(dx=10, dy=-20)
>>> dragon.move(horizontal=10, vertical=-20)

* Good: encapsulation, object knows current position and moves
* Bad: controller computes final offset
* Bad: requires knowledge of business logic (inverted y-axis)
* Bad: the user must know the internals, how to calculate the position, which way is up or down (positive or negative shifting), note that ``y=-20`` means go up by 20 (we have inverted ``y`` axis)
* Decision: rejected


Option 11
---------
>>> dragon.move(0, 10, 0, 20)

>>> dragon.move((0, 10, 0, 20))

>>> dragon.move([
...     (0, 10, 0, 20),
...     (0, 10, 0, 20)])

* Good: there is only one method ``move()`` responsible for moving
* Bad: Python has keyword arguments, so use it
* Bad: require knowledge of an API
* Bad: not extensible to 3D
* Bad: requires knowledge of business logic (inverted y-axis)
* Bad: the user must know the internals, how to calculate the position, which way is up or down (positive or negative shifting), note that ``y=-20`` means go up by 20 (we have inverted ``y`` axis)
* Decision: rejected

Example:

* ``move(left, right, up, down)``

Problem:

* ``check(True, False, None)``

>>> read_csv_with_delimiter_encoding_verbose('iris.csv', ';', 'utf-8', True)

>>> file = ReadCSV('iris.csv')  # encapsulation?!
>>> file.set_encoding('utf-8')
>>> file.set_delimiter(';')
>>> file.set_verbose(True)

>>> file = ReadCSV('iris.csv') \
...               .withEncoding('utf-8') \
...               .withDelimiter(';') \
...               .withVerbose(True)

...                 delimiter=';',
...                 verbose=True)

* Bad: to complex for now


Decision
--------
>>> dragon.move(left=10, down=20)

* Good: easy
* Good: verbose
* Good: extensible (easy to convert to 3D)

Alternative, maybe in future:

>>> dragon.change_position(left=10, down=20)

* Good: consistent with ``set_position()`` and ``get_position()``
* Good: verbose
* Good: extensible
* Bad: a bit too complex for now
