Dragon ADR Init Position
========================
* ADR - Architecture Design Records


Problem
-------
* Set Dragon's initial position to x=50, y=120


Option 1
--------
>>> dragon = Dragon('Wawelski', 50, 120)

* Good: easy to use
* Bad: not explicit enough
* Bad: requires knowledge of API to answer what are those numbers
* Bad: It does suggest, that x and y are some parameters to texture (for example width and height of a texture image, or gold and hit points)
* Decision: rejected, not explicit

Problems:

>>> dragon = Dragon('Wawelski', 0, 0)
>>> dragon = Dragon('Wawelski', None, None)
>>> dragon = Dragon('Wawelski', 'img/dragon/alive.png', 50, 120)

>>> pt = Point(1, 2)                # maybe
>>> pt = PointXY(1, 2)              # ok, but the name is overkill
>>> pt = CartesianAxisPoint(1, 2)   # ok
>>> pt = GPSPoint(1, 2)             # bad

>>> knn = KNearestNeighbors(3)              # ok
>>> knn = KNearestNeighbors(3, [1,2,3])     # bad


Option 2
--------
>>> dragon = Dragon('Wawelski', x=50, y=120)

* Good: easy to use
* Good: short argument names
* Good: verbose in this example
* Good: you can assign ``None`` by default to set default point
* Good: extensible, easy to add ``z`` with default value ``0``
* Bad: It does suggest, that x and y are some parameters to texture (for example width and height of a texture image)
* Decision: rejected, not explicit enough

Problems:

>>> dragon = Dragon('Wawelski', x=0, y=0)
>>> dragon = Dragon('Wawelski', x=None, y=None)
>>> dragon = Dragon('Wawelski', texture='img/dragon/alive.png', x=50, y=120)

>>> pt = Point(x=1, y=2)                        # ok
>>> pt = PointXY(x=1, y=2)                      # ok, but the name is overkill
>>> pt = CartesianAxisPoint(x=1, y=2)           # ok
>>> pt = GPSPoint(x=1, y=2)                     # bad, GPS uses lon, lat

>>> knn = KNearestNeighbors(k=3)                # ok
>>> knn = KNearestNeighbors(k=3, w=[1,2,3])     # bad

Option 3
--------
>>> dragon = Dragon('Wawelski', posx=50, posy=120)
>>> dragon = Dragon('Wawelski', pos_x=50, pos_y=120)

* Good: simple, easy to use
* Good: you can assign ``None`` by default to set default point
* Good: extensible, easy to add ``pos_z`` with default value ``0``
* Bad: not verbose
* Decision: rejected, not explicit enough

Problem:

>>> dragon = Dragon('Wawelski', posx=0, posy=0)         # maybe, bad
>>> dragon = Dragon('Wawelski', pos_x=None, pos_y=None) # maybe, bad

>>> pt = GPSPoint(lo=1, la=2)       # bad
>>> pt = GPSPoint(lon=1, lat=2)     # ok

>>> knn = KNearestNeighbors(k=3, wgt=[1,2,3])           # bad


Option 4
--------
>>> dragon = Dragon('Wawelski', positionx=50, positiony=120)
>>> dragon = Dragon('Wawelski', positionX=50, positionY=120)

* Good: simple, easy to use
* Good: you can assign ``None`` by default to set default point
* Good: extensible, easy to add ``positionZ`` with default value ``0``
* Decision: candidate, but names could be better

Example:

>>> pt = GPSPoint(longitude=1, latitude=2)         # ok
>>> knn = KNearestNeighbors(k=3, weights=[1,2,3])  # ok

Problem:

>>> df.plot(kind='line', subplots=True, color='grey', sharey=True)  # bad


Option 5
--------
>>> dragon = Dragon('Wawelski', position_x=50, position_y=120)

* Good: simple, easy to use
* Good: you can assign ``None`` by default to set default point
* Good: extensible, easy to add ``position_z`` with default value ``0``
* Good: backward compatible
* Decision: candidate

Solution:

>>> df.plot(kind='line', sub_plots=True, color='grey', share_y=True)      # ok
>>> df.plot(kind='line', sub_plots=True, color='grey', share_y_axis=True) # ok
>>> df.plot(kind='line', sub_plots=True, color='grey', share_axis_y=True) # ok


Option 6
--------
>>> dragon = Dragon('Wawelski', pos=(50, 120))
>>> dragon = Dragon('Wawelski', pos=[50, 120])

* Good: data is stored together (``x`` and ``y`` coordinates)
* Good: simple, easy to use
* Good: you can assign ``None`` to set default ``pos``
* Good: always has to pass both ``x`` and ``y`` coordinates together
* Bad: always has to pass both ``x`` and ``y`` coordinates together
* Bad: cannot set only one axis to ``None``
* Bad: you have to know that first is ``x`` and second is ``y``
* Bad: order is important, you cannot change it
* Bad: unpacking
* Bad: not extensible, ``pos`` will always be 2D
* Decision: rejected, not extensible

Problem:

>>> dragon = Dragon('Wawelski', pos=[0, 0])         # ok
>>> dragon = Dragon('Wawelski', pos=[None, None])   # maybe

* ``pattern = r'[\(\[(\s*?:\d+|None\s*)\s*,\s*(\s*?:\d+|None\s*)[\)\]]'``

* Bad: cannot set only one axis to ``None``
* Bad: you have to know that first is ``x`` and second is ``y``
* Bad: order is important, you cannot change it
* Bad: unpacking
* Bad: not extensible, ``position`` will always be 2D
* Decision: rejected, not extensible

Problem:

>>> dragon = Dragon('Wawelski', position=[0, 0])         # ok
>>> dragon = Dragon('Wawelski', position=[None, None])   # maybe

* ``pattern = r'[\(\[(\s*?:\d+|None\s*)\s*,\s*(\s*?:\d+|None\s*)[\)\]]'``


Option 8
--------
>>> dragon = Dragon('Wawelski', posxy=(50, 120))
>>> dragon = Dragon('Wawelski', pos_xy=(50, 120))
>>> dragon = Dragon('Wawelski', position_xy=(50, 120))

* Good: data is stored together (``x`` and ``y`` coordinates)
* Good: simple, easy to use
* Good: you can assign ``None`` by default to set default ``position``
* Good: always has to pass both ``x`` and ``y``
* Bad: always has to pass both ``x`` and ``y``

* Decision: rejected, not extensible

Problem:

* ``pattern = r'[\(\[(\s*?:\d+|None\s*)\s*,\s*(\s*?:\d+|None\s*)[\)\]]'``


Option 9

>>> dragon = Dragon('Wawelski', pos={'x':50, 'y':120})
>>> dragon = Dragon('Wawelski', position={'x':50, 'y':120})

* Good: data is stored together (``x`` and ``y`` coordinates)
* Good: you can assign ``None`` by default to set default point
* Good: order is not important
* Good: always has to pass both ``x`` and ``y``
* Good: possible to extend to 3D with refactoring
* Good: easier to refactor than tuple - ``pattern = r'\{"x":\d+, "y":\d+\}'``
* Bad: always has to pass both ``x`` and ``y``
* Bad: unpacking
* Bad: not extensible, ``position`` will always be 2D
* Decision: rejected, not extensible

Problem:

* ``pattern = r'\{\s*"x"\s*:\s*(?:\d+|None)\s*,\s*"y"\s*:\s*(?:\d+|None)\s*\}'``


Option 10
--------
>>> from collections import namedtuple
>>>
>>>
>>> Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
>>>
>>> dragon = Dragon('Wawelski', Point(50, 120))

* Good: lightweight, in the end this is a tuple
* Bad: always has to pass both ``x`` and ``y``
* Bad: not extensible, ``position`` will always be 2D
* Decision: rejected, could be done better
