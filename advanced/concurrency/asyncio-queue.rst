AsyncIO Queue
=============
* ``asyncio`` queues are designed to be similar to classes of the ``queue`` module.
* Although ``asyncio`` queues are not thread-safe, they are designed to be used specifically in async/await code.
* Note that methods of asyncio queues don't have a timeout parameter; use`` asyncio.wait_for()`` function to do queue operations with a timeout.


FIFO Queue
----------
* FIFO Queue - First In, First Out
* class ``asyncio.Queue(maxsize=0)``
* If maxsize is less than or equal to zero, the queue size is infinite.
* Unlike the standard library threading queue, the size of the queue is always known and can be returned by calling the qsize() method.
* ``maxsize`` - Number of items allowed in the queue.
* ``empty()`` - Return True if the queue is empty, False otherwise.
* ``full()`` - Return True if there are maxsize items in the queue.
* coroutine ``get()`` - Remove and return an item from the queue. If queue is empty, wait until an item is available.
* ``get_nowait()`` - Return an item if one is immediately available, else raise QueueEmpty.
* coroutine ``join()`` - Block until all items in the queue have been received and processed.
* coroutine ``put(item)`` - Put an item into the queue. If the queue is full, wait until a free slot is available before adding the item.
* ``put_nowait(item)`` - Put an item into the queue without blocking. If no free slot is immediately available, raise QueueFull.
* ``qsize()`` - Return the number of items in the queue.
* ``task_done()`` - Indicate that a formerly enqueued task is complete.


Priority Queue
--------------
* class ``asyncio.PriorityQueue``
* Retrieves entries in priority order (lowest first).
* Entries are typically tuples of the form (priority_number, data).


LIFO Queue
----------
* LIFO Queue - Last In, First Out
* class ``asyncio.LifoQueue``
* Retrieves most recently added entries first.


Exceptions
----------
* exception ``asyncio.QueueEmpty`` - Raised when ``get_nowait()`` method is called on an empty queue.
* exception ``asyncio.QueueFull`` - Raised when ``put_nowait()`` method is called on a queue that has reached its maxsize.

            await asyncio.sleep(sleep_for)

            # Notify the queue that the "work item" has been processed.
            queue.task_done()
