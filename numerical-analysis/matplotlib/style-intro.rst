    Figure Anatomy

Axes
----
* A given figure can contain many Axes, but a given Axes object can only be in one Figure
* Data limits can be controlled via ``set_xlim()`` and ``set_ylim()`` methods
* Each Axes has a title (set via ``set_title()``), an x-label (set via ``set_xlabel()``), and a y-label (set via ``set_ylabel()``)

Axis
----
* These are the number-line-like objects
* Axis can be integers

.. code-block:: python

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from matplotlib.ticker import MaxNLocator

    x = np.linspace(0, 2, 100)

    ax = plt.figure().gca()  # ``gca`` - get current axes

    ax.plot(x, x, label='linear')
    ax.plot(x, x**2, label='quadratic')
    ax.plot(x, x**3, label='cubic')

    ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(MaxNLocator(integer=True))

Artist
------
* Everything you can see on the figure is an artist (even the Figure, Axes, and Axis objects)
* This includes Text objects, Line2D objects, collection objects, Patch objects, etc
* Most Artists are tied to an Axes; such an Artist cannot be shared by multiple Axes, or moved from one to another
