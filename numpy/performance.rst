    CPU
    Central Processing Unit
        A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor, main processor or just processor, is the electronic circuitry within a computer that executes instructions that make up a computer program. [#WikipediaCPU]_

    GPU
    Graphics Processing Unit
        A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device. [#WikipediaGPU]_

    ALU
    Arithmetic Logic Unit
        An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a combinational digital electronic circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers. [#WikipediaALU]_

    FPU
    Floating-Point Unit
        A floating-point unit (FPU, colloquially a math coprocessor) is a part of a computer system specially designed to carry out operations on floating-point numbers. [#WikipediaFPU]_

    TPU
    Tensor Processing Unit
        A tensor processing unit (TPU) is an AI accelerator application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) developed by Google specifically for neural network machine learning, particularly using Google's own TensorFlow software. [#WikipediaTPU]_
