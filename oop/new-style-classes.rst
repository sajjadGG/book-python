New and Old Style Class
=======================
* Old Style classes - Not existing in Python 3
* In Python 3 class will always produce new style class
* The major motivation for introducing new-style classes is to provide a unified object model with a full meta-model
* https://docs.python.org/dev/tutorial/classes.html


Old Style classes
-----------------
* Not existing in Python 3
* Don't inherit from ``object``
* In Python 3, there are no old-style classes, and this code will produce new style class


New Style Class
---------------
* Introduced in Python 2.2
* In Python 3 this is the only way
* Inherit from object or from another new style class
* Ability to subclass most built-in types
* ``super()`` added
* MRO changed
* descriptors added
* new style class objects cannot be raised unless derived from Exception
* ``__slots__`` added


Definition
----------
* Old style classes are **only** in Python 2
* New style classes works in Python 2 (when inherit from object)
* In Python 3 all classes always inherit from object, hence they are new style classes

.. code-block:: python

    # Python 2.x
    # old style class
    # inherits from type

    class MyClass:
        pass

.. code-block:: python

    # Python > 2.2
    # new style class
    # inherits from object

    class MyClass(object):
        pass

.. code-block:: python

    # Python 3.x
    # meta class
    # inherits from type

    class MyClass(metaclass=type):
        pass

.. code-block:: python

    # Python 3.x
    # new style class
    # inherits from object

    class MyClass:
        pass

.. code-block:: python

    # Python 3.x
    # new style class
    # inherits from object

    class MyClass(object):
        pass
