SetUp
-----
>>> import re
>>> TEXT = 'Mark Watney of Ares 3 landed on Mars on: Nov 7th, 2035 at 1:37 pm'


Literals
--------
* Also known as "Literal Characters"
* Occurrence of that character in the string

Syntax:

* ``a`` - exact
* ``a|b`` - alternative

Example:

* ``1`` - number 1 anywhere in text
* ``1|2|3`` - numbers 1, 2 or 3 anywhere in text


Classes
-------
* Also known as "Character classes"
* One out of several characters

Syntax:

* ``[abc]`` - enumeration
* ``[a-z]`` - range

Examples:

* ``[12345]`` - numbers 1,2,3,4 or 5 anywhere in text
* ``[0-9]`` - numbers from 0 to 9 anywhere in text
* ``[a-z]`` - lowercase letters from a to z anywhere in text
* ``[A-Z]`` - uppercase letters from A to Z anywhere in text
* ``[a-zA-Z0-9]`` - uppercase and lowercase letters (from a to z) anywhere in text


Metacharacters
--------------
* Special characters

* ``\`` - backslash
* ``^`` - caret

Negation
--------
* Negation logically inverts qualifier

Syntax:

* ``\Btodo\B`` - anything but word boundary, string "todo" being a part of other word, such as: 'mastodont' or 'autodoc'
* ``\w`` - any unicode alphabet character (lower or upper, also with diacritics (i.e. ąćęłńóśżź...), numbers and underscores
* ``\W`` - anything but any unicode alphabet character (i.e. whitespace, dots, comas, dashes, brackets)

Backreference

* ``\g<number>`` - backreferencing by group number
* ``\g<name>`` - backreferencing by group name
* ``(?P=name)`` - backreferencing by group name

Examples:

* ``\g<2> \g<1> \g<3>``
* ``\g<day> \g<month> \g<year>``
* ``<(?P<tagname>[a-z]+)>(.*)</(?P=tagname)>``


Flags
-----
* ``re.ASCII`` - perform ASCII-only matching instead of full Unicode matching
* ``re.IGNORECASE`` - case-insensitive search
* ``re.LOCALE`` - case-insensitive matching dependent on the current locale (deprecated)
* ``re.MULTILINE`` - match can start in one line, and end in another
* ``re.DOTALL`` - dot (``.``) matches also newline characters
* ``re.UNICODE`` - turns on unicode character support for ``\w``
* ``re.VERBOSE`` - ignores spaces (except ``\s``) and allows for comments in in ``re.compile()``
* ``re.DEBUG`` - display debugging information during pattern compilation


Python
------
* ``re.findall()`` - all matches at once
* ``re.finditer()`` - all matches one at a time
* ``re.search()`` - whether text contains (does not search after first match)
* ``re.match()`` - whether text matches pattern (validation, np. email, ssn, tax id, phone)
* ``re.split()`` - splits text by pattern
* ``re.sub()`` - replaces group matches in text (works best with named groups)
* ``re.compile()`` - prepares pattern for further use (match against it)
