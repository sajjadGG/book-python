Str Clean
=========


Rationale
---------
* Using str methods for cleaning user input
* 80% of machine learning and data science is cleaning data
* Is This the Same Address?
* This is a dump of distinct records of a single address
* Which one of the below is a true address?


Numbers
-------
When comparing age, height, temperature etc, the following numbers has
the same meaning. Therefore after converting to ``float()`` it will be
exactly the same.

>>> age = 21
>>> age = 21.0
>>> age = 21.00
>>> age = '21'
>>> age = '21.0'
>>> age = '21.00'

However, when those values indicates for example a pattern to find in text
their meaning will be different. Pattern 21 and '21.00' will be a completely
different object, so it should not be treated exactly the same.

>>> pattern = 21
>>> pattern = 21.0
>>> pattern = 21.00
>>> pattern = '21'
>>> pattern = '21.0'
>>> pattern = '21.00'


Addresses
---------
The following code is an output from real customer relationship management
(CRM) system, that I wrote in 2000s for a swimming pool in Poznan, Poland.
The output is a result of a ``SELECT DISTINCT(address)`` result in SQL.

Note to english speaking users:

    * ``os.`` - stands for ``osiedle``, a projects of blocks of flats
    * ``ul.`` - stands for ``ulica``, street

Is this the same address?

>>> street = 'os. Jana III Sobieskiego'
>>> street = 'ul. Jana III Sobieskiego'
>>> street = 'ul Jana III Sobieskiego'
>>> street = 'ul.Jana III Sobieskiego'
>>> street = 'ulicaJana III Sobieskiego'
>>> street = 'Ul. Jana III Sobieskiego'
>>> street = 'UL. Jana III Sobieskiego'
>>> street = 'ulica Jana III Sobieskiego'
>>> street = 'Ulica. Jana III Sobieskiego'
>>> street = 'Jana 3 Sobieskiego'
>>> street = 'Jana 3ego Sobieskiego'
>>> street = 'Jana III Sobieskiego'
>>> street = 'Jana Iii Sobieskiego'
>>> street = 'Jana IIi Sobieskiego'
>>> street = 'Jana lll Sobieskiego'  # three small letters 'L'

Yes, this is the same address. Despite having information about two different
geographical entities (osiedle and ulica), this is the same address. Why?
It is just a simple mistake from people who entered data.

``SELECT DISTINCT(address)`` won't show you the number of occurrences for each
result. What seems to be a high error rate at the first glance, in further
analysis happens to be a superbly few mistakes. How come? Number of results for
``os. Jana III Sobieskiego`` was around 50 thousands. The other results was
one or two at most. So, few mistakes from 50k results. That's really good
result.

Why we had those errors? Browser autocomplete. User error while imputing data.
And simple shortcuts during conversation: 'Where do you live?',
'at Sobieskiego the IIIrd'. There is only one place in Poznan, Poland with
that name, so it was precise during the conversation. But, receiving party
put that incorrectly to the database assuming that it was ``ulica`` which is
far more common then ``osiedle`` addresses.

Address prefix (street, road, court, place, etc.):

>>> prefix = 'ul'
>>> prefix = 'ul.'
>>> prefix = 'Ul.'
>>> prefix = 'UL.'
>>> prefix = 'ulica'
>>> prefix = 'Ulica'
>>>
>>> prefix = 'os'
>>> prefix = 'os.'
>>> prefix = 'Os.'
>>> prefix = 'osiedle'
>>> prefix = 'oś'
>>> prefix = 'oś.'
>>> prefix = 'Oś.'
>>> prefix = 'ośedle'
>>>
>>> prefix = 'pl'
>>> prefix = 'pl.'
>>> prefix = 'Pl.'
>>> prefix = 'plac'
>>>
>>> prefix = 'al'
>>> prefix = 'al.'
>>> prefix = 'Al.'
>>> prefix = 'aleja'
>>> prefix = 'aleia'
>>> prefix = 'alei'
>>> prefix = 'aleii'
>>> prefix = 'aleji'

House and apartment number:

>>> address = 'Ćwiartki 3/4'
>>> address = 'Ćwiartki 3 / 4'
>>> address = 'Ćwiartki 3 m. 4'
>>> address = 'Ćwiartki 3 m 4'
>>> address = 'Brighton Beach 1st apt 2'
>>> address = 'Brighton Beach 1st apt. 2'
>>> address = 'Myśliwiecka 3/5/7'
>>>
>>> address = 'Jana Twardowskiego 180f/8f'
>>> address = 'Jana Twardowskiego 180f/8'
>>> address = 'Jana Twardowskiego 180/8f'
>>>
>>> address = 'Jana Twardowskiego III 3 m. 3'
>>> address = 'Jana Twardowskiego 13d bud. A piętro II sala 3'

Phone Numbers:
--------------
Which one is mobile, and which is landline?

>>> phone = '+48 (12) 355 5678'
>>> phone = '+48 123 555 678'

Note, the numbers. They are completely the same. Your

>>> phone = '123 555 678'
>>> phone = '123555678'
>>> phone = '+48123555678'
>>> phone = '+48 12 355 5678'
>>> phone = '+48 123-555-678'
>>> phone = '+48 123 555 6789'
>>> phone = '+1 (123) 555-6789'
>>> phone = '+1 (123).555.6789'
>>>
>>> phone = '+1 800-python'
>>> phone = '+1 800-798466'
>>>
>>> phone = '+48 123 555 678 wew. 1337'
>>> phone = '+48 123555678,1'
>>> phone = '+48 123555678,1,,2'


Date and Time

>>> date = '12.4.1961'
>>> date = '12.04.1961'
>>> date = '12-04-1961'
>>> date = '12/04/1961'
>>> date = '4/12/61'
>>> date = '4.12.1961'
>>> date = 'Apr 12, 1961'
>>> date = 'Apr 12th, 1961'
