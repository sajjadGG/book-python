The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

* Beautiful is better than ugly.
* **Explicit is better than implicit.**
* **Simple is better than complex.**
* Complex is better than complicated.
* Flat is better than nested.
* Sparse is better than dense.
* **Readability counts.**
* **Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.**
* Although practicality beats purity.
* Errors should never pass silently.
* Unless explicitly silenced.
* In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
* There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
* Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
* Now is better than never.
* Although never is often better than *right* now.
* **If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.**
* If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
* Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
