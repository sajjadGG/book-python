.. _Basic Files Append:

***********
File Append
***********


Rationale
=========
.. highlights::
    * Appends data at the end of file
    * Creates file if not exists
    * Works with both relative and absolute path
    * Fails when directory with file cannot be accessed
    * ``mode`` parameter to ``open()`` function is required
    * ``.writelines()`` does not add a line separator!!


Appending to file
=================
.. highlights::
    * Append to the end of file

.. code-block:: python

    FILE = r'/tmp/myfile.txt'
    DATA = 'We choose to go to the Moon...'

    with open(FILE, mode='a') as file:
        file.write(DATA)
